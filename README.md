Solidity, blockchain and smart contract python tutorial by [freecodecamp.org](https://youtu.be/M576WGiDBdQ?si=pm85AbSuSul5XToF)

## Introduction
+ `Smart Contracts` allow for agreements without centralized intermediaries. They are self executing sets of instructions, without 3rd parties. 
+ `The Oracle problem` they run within isolated containers, blockchain oracles allow the containers to recieve data from external. 
+ `Chainlink` provies data and external computation to smart contracts, it allows for unlimited smart contract customization. 
+ `Hybrid smart contracts` combine on-chainand and off-chain components.
+ `Dapps` = `smart contracts` = `Decentralized applications`. 

### Advantages
1. Decentralized
2. Transparency and credibility
3. Speed and efficiency
4. Secure and Immutable
5. Remove of counterparty risk
6. Trust minimized agreements
